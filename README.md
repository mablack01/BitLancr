# ByteLancr
ByteLancr is a platform that provides an environment for free-lance developers and businesses to complete contracts. This project consists of two components, the front end project and the back end project.

# Front End
In order to run the front end project, navigate to the **frontend** folder and open terminal. Assuming you have [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) setup, run the ```npm install``` command if it is your first time running the project in order to set things up. You can now use the command ```npm start``` to run the front end project. 

The project is hosted on http://localhost:4200/
